I am a Data Scientist at [OpenHouse.ai](https://openhouse.ai/) and a Master's student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I previously obtained my MASc in Industrial Engineering from the University of Windsor.

My research interests primarily cover a broad range of topics in machine learning and optimization in both applied and theoretical settings. To mention a few:
- Graph representation learning, and deep learning on graphs.
- Deep reinforcement learning and sequential decision-making.
- Combinatorial optimization and operations research.
-	Learning to optimize & Decision-focused learning.
  
Beyond these specific topics, I maintain a strong interest in the foundations of AI, keeping a close eye on advances in **optimization techniques**, **learning dynamics**, **meta-learning**, and **multi-task learning**.
