I'm currently a MSc. Student and Research Assistant in the Industrial Engineering Department at University of Windsor under the supervision of [Dr. Guoqing Zhang](https://www.uwindsor.ca/engineering/mame/337/dr-guoqing-zhang).

My research interests primarily cover a broad range of topics in machine learning and optimization in both applied and theoretical sense. To mention a few:
- Graph representation learning, and geometric deep learning.
- Deep reinforcement learning and sequential decision-making.
- Mathematical optimization and operations research.
-	Learning to optimize & Decision-focused learning.
  
Moreover, I always have an eye for advances and research in fundamental areas of AI such as novel deep learnig **optimization techniques**, **learning methods and dynamics**, **meta-learning** and **multi-task learning**.
