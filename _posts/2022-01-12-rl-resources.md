## Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm of AI methodologies in which an agent learns to interact with its environment in order to maximize the expectation of reward signals received from its environment. Unlike supervised learning, in which the agent is given labeled examples and learns to predict an output based on input, RL involves the agent actively taking actions in its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. This feedback is used to adjust the agent’s behavior and improve its performance over time.

RL has been applied to a wide range of domains, including robotics, natural language processing, and finance. In the gaming industry, RL has been used to develop advanced game-playing agents, such as the **AlphaGo [1]** algorithm that defeated a human champion in the board game Go. In the healthcare industry, RL has been used to optimize treatment plans for patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes. RL has also been used in the field of robotics, allowing robots to learn and adapt to new environments and tasks.

One of the most iconic recent breakthroughs in RL is the development of [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) [2] by OpenAI, a natural language processing system that can hold intelligent conversations with humans. chatGPT was trained on a large dataset of human conversations and can generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses to user inputs. This system demonstrates the potential for RL to be used to improve natural language processing systems and create more human-like AI assistants.
