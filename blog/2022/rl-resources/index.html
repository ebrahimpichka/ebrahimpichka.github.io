Unlike supervised learning, in which the agent is given labeled examples and learns to predict an output based on input, RL involves the agent actively taking actions in its environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. This feedback is used to adjust the agent’s behavior and improve its performance over time.</p> <p>RL has been applied to a wide range of domains, including robotics, natural language processing, and finance. In the gaming industry, RL has been used to develop advanced game-playing agents, such as the <strong>AlphaGo [1]</strong> algorithm that defeated a human champion in the board game Go. In the healthcare industry, RL has been used to optimize treatment plans for patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes. RL has also been used in the field of robotics, allowing robots to learn and adapt to new environments and tasks.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2038/1*Y6mxK5VOgXkOlwlqv3TJNQ.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>One of the most iconic recent breakthroughs in RL is the development of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">chatGPT</a> [2] by OpenAI, a natural language processing system that can hold intelligent conversations with humans. chatGPT was trained on a large dataset of human conversations and can generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses to user inputs. This system demonstrates the potential for RL to be used to improve natural language processing systems and create more human-like AI assistants.</p> <p>As RL continues to advance and make an impact in various fields, it has become increasingly important for professionals and researchers to have a strong understanding of this technique.

Alexander Zai and Brandon Brown, “Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action”</a></h3> <p>“Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action” by Alexander Zai and Brandon Brown is an in-depth guide that takes the reader through the process of building intelligent systems using deep reinforcement learning. The book starts by introducing the basic concepts and algorithms of reinforcement learning, including Q-learning and policy gradients. It then goes on to cover more advanced topics such as actor-critic methods and deep Q-networks (DQN), which are used to improve the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.</p> <p>One of the key features of the book is its emphasis on hands-on examples and exercises. Throughout the book, the authors provide code snippets and sample projects that illustrate how to implement reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. These examples and exercises are designed to help readers understand the material and apply it to their own projects.</p> <p>In addition to covering the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, the book also covers recent advances in the field such as double DQN, prioritized replay, and A3C. These techniques are used to improve the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms and make them more efficient. The book is intended for readers with some experience in machine learning and deep learning, but no prior experience with reinforcement learning is required. The authors provide a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the field, making it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced practitioners.</p> <p><strong>Book Chapters:</strong></p> <ol> <li>What is reinforcement learning </li> <li>Modeling reinforcement learning problems: Markov decision processes </li> <li>Predicting the best states and actions: Deep Q-networks </li> <li>Learning to pick the best policy: Policy gradient methods </li> <li>Tackling more complex problems with actor-critic methods </li> <li>Alternative optimization methods: Evolutionary algorithms </li> <li>Distributional DQN: Getting the full story </li> <li>Curiosity-driven exploration </li> <li>Multi-agent reinforcement learning </li> <li>Interpretable reinforcement learning: Attention and relational model </li> <li>conclusion: A review and roadmap </li> </ol> <h3 id="5-maxim-lapan-deep-reinforcement-learning-hands-on"><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/deep-reinforcement-learning-hands-on-second-edition/9781838826994" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">5.
